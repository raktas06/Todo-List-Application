# Creating REST API using Laravel 

1. Create Project::
composer create-project laravel/laravel taskAPI "10.*"
php artisan make:controller PostController.php

Use command for add "vendor" folder:: "composer update"

All RestAPI command test in PostMan also.
Create, Update, Read, Delete from PostMan and after same from Front-end UI also using Ajax + jQuery

Today's class we're understand CRUD using Ajax+jQuery in Laravel but not file uploading.
Here also understand server side validation in Ajax CRUD.
We need to add here clientside validation...
